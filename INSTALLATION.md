# Installing Zowe Server Components on z/OS

Within the Zowe project, there exists several components for both client and server, z/OS and PC.
Among them are the Zowe servers; Software that is run usually on z/OS, though some of these servers may also be capable of running in linux environment such as in containers.

This document covers installation and configuration of Zowe's core server components on z/OS.

**Note: This document is meant as a quick-start guide. Advanced topics of configuration, including networking, are not covered here, but instead can be found on [docs.zowe.org](https://docs.zowe.org)**

## Concepts

Familiarize yourself with these core concepts of the Zowe servers, which are referenced during installation and configuration.

### Installation Concepts
Runtime: The read-only content that comprises a version of Zowe.

**Instance**: A collection of configuration and persistent data for Zowe that uses a particular Runtime.

**HA Instance**: An optional subset of an Instance which varies its configuration for redundant copies of Zowe components across one or more LPARs for high availability and fault tolerance.

**Component**: A unit of software that is managed by Zowe's launcher and has a folder structure that allows Zowe's tools to manage it. Components may contain a webserver or an extension to another component.

**Extension**: A component which is not part of the Zowe core server Components. This could be an extension from the Zowe project, or from a 3rd party. Extensions do not exist in the Runtime directory. They are instead linked to Zowe via the Extension directory.

**Keystore**: Zowe has several HTTPS servers which require certificates to function. You can store these certificates in a Keyring, or in a ZFS Keystore directory in the form of PKCS12 files.

### Configuration Concepts
**Zowe YAML File**: Each Instance is configured by a YAML document composed of one or more unix file or PDSE member. It can be as simple as a "zowe.yaml" unix file, or ZWEYAML parmlib member, or advanced configuration can be accomplished by splitting configuration across multiple such files. This allows for defaults and customizations, splitting the configuration by administrative duty, or even splitting the configuration by core configuration versus extension configuration. 

**Schema**: The YAML file is backed by a Schema, found within `runtimeDirectory/schemas` ([link](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/v2.x/staging/schemas)). Whenever Zowe starts up, or when most `zwe` commands are used, Zowe will check that the YAML file is valid before executing the requested operation, to reduce chance of misconfiguration. The schema also details advanced configuration parameters that may not be needed in basic installs.

**Configuration Templates**: Each YAML file can contain values that have templates within in the form of `${{ item }}` where the item within can be a reference to another property in the YAML, an environment variable, system symbol, or even simple conditional logic of them. This allows you to have configuration that works across multiple systems, such as by tying a hostname to `${{ zos.resolveSymbol('&SYSNAME') }}` to have the value be whatever the SYSNAME symbol is on a given LPAR. <br>([examples](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/blob/c09f2a0763fa7c2925dc01489e89a71ba7b62fec/docs/images/configure/templating.png))

**Workspace**: Each Instance has an area where Components can store data to persist across Zowe restarts or IPLs. Runtime state should instead be stored in the Caching Service component if high availability and fault tolerance is a concern, whereas the workspace instead covers items like user preferences.

## Distribution

The Zowe server components are distributed in multiple forms, such as SMPE, PSWI, and even PAX archive. You can find Zowe's official distributions at [zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/download)

## Installation of Runtime

The following covers installation when not using the Zowe Server Install Wizard. When using that instead, please refer to the prompts within it instead of this guide.

### SMPE or PSWI
1. When you install Zowe via SMPE or PSWI, the Runtime directory and datasets will be populated.
2. Navigate to the Runtime Directory and copy the [`example-zowe.yaml`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v3.x/master/example-zowe.yaml) file to a location outside this folder, generally wherever you want to put the Zowe Instance.
3. Edit the YAML copy to set the values of `zowe.runtimeDirectory`, `java.home`, `node.home`, and `zowe.setup.dataset`, as follows
   1. `zowe.runtimeDirectory`: The location you extracted the PAX to.
   2. `java.home`: The location of the Java that will be used when installing & running Zowe. For example, if your java is located at /usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64/bin/java, then the java.home is /usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64
   3. `node.home`: The location of the NodeJS that will be used when installing & running ZOwe. For example, if your node is located at /usr/lpp/node/v18/bin/node, then the java.home is /usr/lpp/node/v18
   4. `zowe.setup.dataset`: This section defines where both Runtime and Instance datasets of Zowe will be created.


### PAX
1. Extract the PAX on some ZFS partition on z/OS (For example, `pax -ppx -rf zowe.pax`). At least 1200MB of free space is required.  The location you extract to is the "Runtime Directory"
2. Navigate to the Runtime Directory and copy the [`example-zowe.yaml`](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v3.x/master/example-zowe.yaml) file to a location outside this folder, generally wherever you want to put the Zowe Instance.
3. Edit the YAML copy to set the values of `zowe.runtimeDirectory`, `java.home`, `node.home`, and `zowe.setup.dataset`, as follows
   1. `zowe.runtimeDirectory`: The location you extracted the PAX to.
   2. `java.home`: The location of the Java that will be used when installing & running Zowe. For example, if your java is located at /usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64/bin/java, then the java.home is /usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64
   3. `node.home`: The location of the NodeJS that will be used when installing & running ZOwe. For example, if your node is located at /usr/lpp/node/v18/bin/node, then the java.home is /usr/lpp/node/v18
   4. `zowe.setup.dataset`: This section defines where both Runtime and Instance datasets of Zowe will be created.
5. Navigate to the `/bin` folder of the extracted location
6. Run `./zwe install -c /path/to/zowe.yaml`. This creates the Runtime datasets for the Zowe release.



## Configuration of Instance

The following covers configuration when not using the Zowe Server Install Wizard. When using that instead, please refer to the prompts within it instead of this guide.
Aside from the Zowe Server Install Wizard, there are three other ways to configure a Zowe Instance.
1. **JCL samples**: The Zowe Runtime dataset SZWESAMP contains templates of JCL that must be substituted with Zowe YAML parameters before executed. That can be done manually, or automatically via editing and submitting the job ZWEGENER, which will place resolved JCL into the PDSE defined at `zowe.setup.dataset.jcllib`
2. **zwe operations**: `zwe` is a Unix CLI program that has commands which will automate the execution of the JCL samples.
3. **z/OSMF workflow**: The z/OSMF workflows will prompt you for Zowe YAML parameters before submitting jobs equivalent to the actions seen in the JCL samples.

<br>
<br>

### Configuration by JCL
---
The Zowe Runtime Dataset `SZWESAMP` contains JCL samples that have templates referencing Zowe YAML parameters.
They cannot be submitted without modification as a result.

It is recommended to edit and submit the job SZWESAMP([ZWEGENER](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEGENER)) which will validate the contents of your Zowe YAML before resolving the JCL templates and placing the resulting JCL into a separate PDSE created during installation, located at the value of `zowe.setup.dataset.jcllib`.

When the JCL is prepared, the following jobs can be submitted to perform the following Instance configuration actions:

#### Core Tasks
---

|Task|Description|Sample JCL|
|---|---|---|
|Create Instance Datasets|**Purpose:** Create datasets for Zowe's PARMLIB content and non-ZFS extension content for a given Zowe Instance<br><br>**Action:**<br>1) Allocate PDSE FB80 dataset with at least 15 tracks named from Zowe parameter `zowe.setup.dataset.parmlib`<br>2) Allocate PDSE FB80 dataset with at least 30 tracks named from Zowe parameter `zowe.setup.dataset.authPluginLib`<br>3) Copy ZWESIP00 member from `zowe.setup.dataset.prefix`.SZWESAMP into `zowe.setup.dataset.parmlib`|[ZWEIMVS](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEIMVS)|
|APF Authorize privileged content|**Purpose:** Zowe contains one privileged component, ZIS, which enables the security model by which the majority of Zowe is unprivileged and in key 8. The load library for the ZIS component and its extension library must be set APF authorized and run in key 4 to use ZIS and components that depend upon it.<br><br>**Action:**<br>1) APF authorize the datasets defined at `zowe.setup.dataset.authLoadlib` and `zowe.setup.dataset.authPluginLib`.<br>2) Define PPT entries for the members ZWESIS01 and ZWESAUX as Key 4, NOSWAP in the SCHEDxx member of the system PARMLIB.|[ZWEIAPF](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEIAPF)|
|Grant SAF permissions|The STC accounts for Zowe need permissions for operating servers, and users need permissions for interacting with the servers.<br><br>**Action:** [Set SAF permissions for accounts](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/assign-security-permissions-to-users#security-permissions-reference-table)|RACF: [ZWEIRAC](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEIRAC)<br><br>TSS: [ZWEITSS](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEITSS)<br><br>ACF2: [ZWEIACF](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/SZWIACF)|
|Copy STC JCL to PROCLIB|**Purpose**: ZWESLSTC is the job for running Zowe's webservers, and ZWESISTC is for running the APF authorized cross-memory server. The ZWESASTC job is started by ZWESISTC on an as-needed basis.<br><br>**Action**: Copy the members ZWESLSTC, ZWESISTC, and ZWESASTC into your desired PROCLIB. If the job names are customized, also modify the YAML values of them in `zowe.setup.security.stcs`|[ZWEISTC](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/feature/v3/jcl/files/SZWESAMP/ZWEISTC)|


#### Keyring Tasks
---

**Certificate requirements**: Zowe's keyring must have the following
* **Private key & certificate pair**: The Zowe Servers will use this certificate, and it must either not have the "Extended Key Usage" attribute, or have it with both "Server Authorization" and "Client Authorization" values.
* **Certificate Authorities**: Every intermediate and root Certificate Authority (CA) Zowe interacts with must be within the Keyring, unless the YAML value `zowe.verifyCertificates` is set to `DISABLED`. CAs that must be within the keyring include z/OSMF's CAs if using z/OSMF, and Zowe's own certificate's CAs as Zowe servers must be able to verify each other.

There are 4 options for setting up keyrings: Three scenarios covered by JCL samples where a keyring is created for you, or a fourth where you can bring your own keyring.

If you already have a keyring that meets the requirements, you can configure Zowe to use it by configuring Zowe YAML values within `zowe.certificate` as follows:

```yaml
zowe:
  certificate:
    keystore:
      type: JCERACFKS
      file: "safkeyring://<STC Account Name>/<Ring Name>"
      alias: "<Name of your certificate>"
      password: "password" #literally "password". keyrings do not use passwords, so this is a placeholder.
    truststore:
      type: JCERACFKS
      file: "safkeyring://<STC Account Name>/<Ring Name>"
      password: "password" #literally "password". keyrings do not use passwords, so this is a placeholder.
```

### Configuration by zwe
---

`zwe` is a unix tool located in the `<Runtime Directory>/bin` directory of Zowe.
If you type `zwe init --help`, you will see each configuration command that is available.
Each command reads configuration properties from the Zowe YAML files, and combines that with the JCL samples from the SZWESAMP dataset.
The commands resolve the JCL sample templates into usable JCL within the dataset defined by YAML value `zowe.setup.dataset.jcllib`.
Before each command runs, it will print the JCL that it is submitting.

Using `zwe init` is an alternative to using the JCL samples from the previous section.

<details>
<summary>Click here to read about configuring via zwe instead of JCL samples</summary>

Every `zwe init` command also has a `--dry-run` option which validates the configuration, prints the JCL, but does not submit it.
This allows you to review the actions before performing them with the appropriate administrator.

The following commands can be run to set up a Zowe Instance via `zwe`

|Task|Description|Command|Doc|
|---|---|---|---|
|Create Instance Datasets|Creates datasets for holding PARMLIB content and non-ZFS Extension content that is particular to one Zowe instance|`zwe init mvs`|[Doc](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/init/zwe-init-mvs)|
|APF Authorize privileged content|Zowe contains one privileged component, ZIS, which enables the security model by which the majority of Zowe is unprivileged and in key 8. The load library for the ZIS component (SZWEAUTH, or customized via YAML value `zowe.setup.dataset.authLoadlib`) and its extension library (The value value `zowe.setup.dataset.authPluginLib`) must be set APF authorized and run in key 4 to use ZIS and components that depend upon it|`zwe init apfauth`|[Doc](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/init/zwe-init-apfauth)|

|Copy STC JCL to PROCLIB|The jobs for starting the Zowe webservers, ZWESLSTC, and the Zowe APF authorized cross-memory server, ZWESISTC, and its auxiliary address space, ZWESASTC, must be copied to the desired proclib for running. The YAML value `zowe.setup.dataset.proclib` defines where these members will be placed. The names of the members can be customized with YAML value `zowe.setup.security.stcs`|`zwe init stc`|[Doc](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/appendix/zwe_server_command_reference/zwe/init/zwe-init-stc)|


#### Keystore or Keyring Configuration
---

**Certificate requirements**: Zowe's keystore or keyring must have the following
* **Private key & certificate pair**: The Zowe Servers will use this certificate, and it must either not have the "Extended Key Usage" attribute, or have it with both "Server Authorization" and "Client Authorization" values.
* **Certificate Authorities**: Every intermediate and root Certificate Authority (CA) Zowe interacts with must be within the Keyring, unless the YAML value `zowe.verifyCertificates` is set to `DISABLED`. CAs that must be within the keyring include z/OSMF's CAs if using z/OSMF, and Zowe's own certificate's CAs as Zowe servers must be able to verify each other.

There are 6 scenarios for setting up certificates for Zowe to use. There are five scenarios in the YAML to have Zowe create a ZFS PKCS12 keystore, or z/OS keyring, and an additional sixth option to bring your own keyring.

Zowe can use a keyring provided by you as long as the contents meet Zowe's requirements and configure YAML values within `zowe.certificate` as follows:

```yaml
zowe:
  certificate:
    keystore:
      type: JCERACFKS
      file: "safkeyring://<STC Account Name>/<Ring Name>"
      alias: "<Name of your certificate>"
      password: "password" #literally "password". keyrings do not use passwords, so this is a placeholder.
    truststore:
      type: JCERACFKS
      file: "safkeyring://<STC Account Name>/<Ring Name>"
      password: "password" #literally "password". keyrings do not use passwords, so this is a placeholder.
```

## Networking

Most of Zowe's servers are HTTPS servers that communicate with each other and to a client off the mainframe. This section covers the default behaviors and how to customize them.

### Ports
The following lists the default ports of each server of Zowe that is enabled by default.

These are customized within the YAML at `components.<component-name>.port`, such as `components.zss.port` to customize the ZSS port.

|Component|Component Category|TCP Port|Job Name|Log Suffix|Note|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|api-catalog|API Mediation Layer|7552|ZWE1AC|AAC|Provides API documentation|
|discovery|API Mediation Layer|7553|ZWE1AD|ADS|Used by the gateway to discover presence and health each server in a Zowe instance for routing|
|gateway|API Mediation Layer|7554|ZWE1AG|AGW|When enabled, the port chosen should also be the value of `zowe.externalPort`. Zowe can be configured to have this port as the only externally-accessible port as the gateway can proxy the other Zowe servers.|
|caching-service|API Mediation Layer|7555|ZWE1CS|ACS|Provides a cache for high-availability/fault-tolerant operation|
|app-server|App Framework|7556|ZWE1DS|D|Provides the Desktop, requires NodeJS|
|zss|App Framework|7557|ZWE1SZ|SZ|Provides APIs|
|zaas|API Mediation Layer|7558|ZWE1AZ|AZ|Provides security APIs|

Note that the Job name prefix ZWE1 can be modified via the YAML property `zowe.job.prefix`.

Zowe also has a property, `zowe.externalPort` that describes where clients should connect to access Zowe. This must match the gateway port when the gateway is enabled. When it isn't, this port should match the primary server of Zowe that you are using.

### IP Addresses
These servers by default use the TCP IP address `0.0.0.0` which assigns the servers to be available on all network interfaces available to the jobs.

If this default is not desired, it is recommended to use [TCPIP port assignment statements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=assignments-profiletcpip-port) to restrict the IP & ports of each server by their jobnames.
The jobnames of each Zowe component is derived from the property `zowe.job.prefix` + `<component-suffix>`, where the suffix is seen in the port table above.

When `zowe.job.prefix` is "ZWE1", An example of port reservations with a fixed IP of "10.11.12.13" could be:

```
   7552 TCP ZWE1AC BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe API Catalog
   7553 TCP ZWE1AD BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe Discovery
   7554 TCP ZWE1AG BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe Gateway
   7555 TCP ZWE1CS BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe Caching Service
   7556 TCP ZWE1DS BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe App Server
   7557 TCP ZWE1SZ BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe ZSS
   7558 TCP ZWE1AZ BIND 10.11.12.13 ; Zowe ZAAS
```

### TLS configuration

**Not all components support this yet.** 

Some components can have their TLS settings customized with the attribute `zowe.networkSettings`. 

This configuration can also be put under a component that supports it via `components.<component-name>.zowe.networkSettings` such as `components.zss.zowe.networkSettings` for ZSS.

The configuration splits between server configuration (configuration of TLS for content the server sends content) and client configuration (configuration of TLS for when the server requests content from another server)

```yaml
zowe:
  network:
    server:
      listenAddresses:
        - 0.0.0.0 # Can be an ipv4, ipv6, or hostname value.
      tls:
        ciphers: # is a list of IANA-named ciphers that overrides defaults.
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 
        - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
        maxTls: "TLSv1.3" # Can be 1.2 or 1.3
        minTls: "TLSv1.2" # Can be 1.2 or 1.3
    client:
      tls: "${{ zowe.network.server.tls }}" # this is a configmgr template which assigns the client config to the server config for convenience.
```
