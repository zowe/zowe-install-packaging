# Change Log

All notable changes to the Zowe Installer will be documented in this file.
<!--Add the PR or issue number to the entry if available.-->
## `1.24.0`

### New features and enhancements
- A new dataset is created during instance creation. The dataset is to be used for holding ZIS plugins, as an alternative to putting the plugins inside of the ZIS loadlib which is still the default.
- New instance parameters describing ZIS are available and automatically recorded in instance.env if a new install is done via a convenience build. These parameters can be used in future automation of detecting ZIS and installing ZIS plugins
- New instance creation parameters -d or -l, -p, and -z are now available in the instance creation script for manually specifying the new ZIS parameters. 

## `1.20.0`

### New features and enhancements
- server-bundle docker image has been optimized to greatly reduce the size without impacting the content and usability
- server-bundle docker image now runs zowe under the user "zowe", and the default mount locations of instance, keystore, and plugins directories is now within /home/zowe as a result

## `1.17.0`

### New features and enhancements
- You can now start ZSS independent from the Zowe Application Framework server by specifying the `LAUNCH_COMPONENT_GROUP "ZSS"`. If `DESKTOP` is specified instead of `ZSS`, ZSS will still be included as a prerequisite to the Application Framework server. [#1632](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1632)
- Zowe instance configuration script (`zowe-configure-instance.sh`) can now skip checking for Node.js by passing in the `-s` flag since Node.js may not be needed if the components to be launched don't require it. [#1677](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1677)
- The `run-zowe.sh` script can also skip the checking for Node.js by setting the environment variable `SKIP_NODE=1` for the cases where the components to be launched don't require Node.js.
- Exported the `EXTERNAL_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITIES` variable to the `zowe-certificates.env` file such that it may be used by the Application Framework server. [#1742](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1742)

## `1.16.0`

### New features and enhancements
- Moved explorer-ui-server out of explorers into new `shared` folder under Zowe Runtime Directory. It involved following PRs (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1545), (https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/pull/207), (https://github.com/zowe/explorer-ui-server/pull/37). Thanks @stevenhorsman, @nakulmanchanda, @jackjia-ibm
- Created `zowe-setup-keyring-certificates.env` and removed the overloaded properties from `zowe-setup-certificates.env` to try and clarify the user experience when setting up certificates in the keyring and USS keystore modes. [#1603](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1603)


## `1.14.0`

### New features and enhancements
- Allow the user to verify the authenticity of a Zowe driver. The script `zowe-verify-authenticity.sh` will check that a Zowe `ROOT_DIR` for an installed release matches the contents for when that release was created, which assists with support and troubleshooting. To verify pre-1.14 releases, the script and its associated code are available [separately](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/staging/files/fingerprint.pax) (see [#1552](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1552)). For more information, see the new topic [Verify Zowe Runtime Directory](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/troubleshoot/verify-fingerprint.html) that describes the operation of the script. 
- Allow multiple domains (names/IP Addresses) when generating certificates. This also includes SMP/E `HOLDDATA` for the affected function `Zowe Configuration`. [#1511](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1511)
- Included z/OSMF workflows for Zowe z/OS configuration. [#1527](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1527)
- Added warning if `ZWESVSTC` runs under user ID `IZUSVR`. [#1534](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/issues/1534)
- [Docs] Changed the documentation to say that SZWEAUTH PDSE load library members should not be copied elsewhere, but instead that the original installation target SZWEAUTH PDSE should be APF-authorized and used as the runtime load library.  This also includes SMP/E `HOLDDATA` for the affected function `STC JCL` as well as changes to topics [Installing and configuring the Zowe cross memory server (ZWESISTC)](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configure-xmem-server.html) and [Installing and starting the Zowe started task (ZWESVSTC)](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configure-zowe-server.html).  
- [Docs] Added a new topic [Installing and configuring Zowe z/OS components using scripts](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/scripted-configure-server.html).

## `1.13.0`

#### Minor enhancements/defect fixes
- Updated zowe-configure-instance upgrade to update ROOT_DIR [#1414](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1414)
- Update port validation logic to reduce false negatives [#1399](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1399)
- Update install and configure to tolerate ZERT Network Analyzer better [#1124](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/pull/1124)



## `1.12.0`

- Edit default plugin references to point to $ROOT_DIR env var

2020-05-08 Timothy Gerstel <tgerstel@rocketsoftware.com>

  - Set up SSO in a standard install of Zowe via new environment variables set
in zowe-setup-certificates.env

  - Automate conversion of APIML public key and storage within PKCS#11 token

- When the hostname cannot be resolved use the IP address instead.  This covers the scenario when the USS `hostname` command returned a system name that wasn't externally addressable, such as `S0W1.DAL-EBIS.IHOST.COM` which occurs on an image created from the z/OS Application Developers Controlled Distribution (ADCD).
- Separate zss component from app-server component
