# ZWE CLI Documentation Generation

Run `node index.js` to generate documentation for the `zwe` cli in `md` format. The command [documentation files](../../bin/README.md#command-assistant-files) are used to generate documentation.

Generated documentation is added to the `generated/` folder. Files in this folder are not tracked in git.

To adjust the structure of generated `.md` files, `dot-file-structure.js` can be edited with limited javascript code changes.
