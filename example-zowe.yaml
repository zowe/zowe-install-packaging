# You can start each HA instance with `zwe start --ha-instance <ha-instance>`.

#     # This sysname will be used to route your JES command to target system.
#     sysname: LPR1
#     # for this HA instance, we did not customize "components", so it will use default value.

#   # **NOTE**, we can only start one gateway in same LPAR.
