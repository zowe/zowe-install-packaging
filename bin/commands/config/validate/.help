Runs schema validation upon given zowe yaml configuration files.
This command can be used to prove that the zowe configuration is good before starting zowe.
It requires that zowe.useConfigmgr=true or --configmgr are set.
This command can optionally validate enabled components or all components, but otherwise would only validate the zowe core configuration.
