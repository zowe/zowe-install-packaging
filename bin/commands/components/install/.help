Install a Zowe component, given a component archive, component directory, or component name.
When a component name is given instead of a path, the installation will be performed against a Zowe package registry if one is configured.
Archives can be in the .tar, .zip, or pax format where a component is at the root of the archive.

Components are the packaging standard of Zowe.
Zowe has core Components, but extensions are also delivered as Components.
You can read more about them here:
https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/packaging-zos-extensions/

**IMPORTANT NOTES**, by default, this command will enable the component globally
                     by modifying your YAML configuration. You can pass
                     `--skip-enable` to disable this behavior.
