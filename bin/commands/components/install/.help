Installs a Zowe component, given either a path to a directory of a component
Or a path to a .tar, .zip, or .pax archive containing a component at its root.

Components are extensions of Zowe, and you can read more about them here:
https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/packaging-zos-extensions/

**IMPORTANT NOTES**, by default, this command will enable the component globally
                     by modifying your YAML configuration. You can pass
                     `--skip-enable` to disable this behavior.
