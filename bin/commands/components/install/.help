Install a Zowe component, given a component archive, component directory, or component name.
When a component name is given instead of a path, the installation will be performed against a Zowe package registry if one is configured.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**, by default, this command will enable the component globally
                     by modifying your YAML configuration. You can pass
                     `--skip-enable` to disable this behavior.
