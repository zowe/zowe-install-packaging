Init Zowe instance based on zowe.yaml configuration.

You can find an example zowe.yaml in Zowe runtime directory bin folder.

If you specify `--update-config` with this command, these configurations could
be written back to your Zowe YAML configuration file:

- `zowe.certificate` based on your `zowe.setup.certificate` configuration,
- `java.home` based on your current JAVA_HOME or automatic detection,
- `node.home` based on your current NODE_HOME or automatic detection.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are used:

  "PKCS12" (USS keystore) or "JCERACFKS" (z/OS keyring).
- `zowe.setup.certificate.dname` is the distinguished name of the certificate.
  You can define `caCommonName`, `commonName`, `orgUnit`, `org`, `locality`,
  `state`, and / or `country`. These configurations are optional.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.validity` is the validity days of the certificate.

  contain exact one hostname (domain) and one IP address.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.importCertificateAuthorities` is the list of
  certificate authorities will be imported to Zowe PKCS12 keystore or JCERACFKS
  keyring. Please note, for JCERACFKS type, only maximum 2 CAs is supported.
  If you are using `PKCS12` certificate, this should be USS files in PEM format.
  If you are using `JCERACFKS` certificate, this should be certificate labels
  on the z/OS system.

**For `PKCS12` certificate users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.directory` is the directory where you plan to
  store the PKCS12 keystore and truststore. This is required if
  `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is `PKCS12`.
- You can also define `name`, `password`, `caAlias` and `caPassword` under
  `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12` to customized keystore and truststore. These
  configurations are optional, but it is recommended to update them from
  default values.
- Define `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore` if you already acquired
  certificate from other CA, stored them in PKCS12 format, and want to import
  into Zowe PKCS12 keystore.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.password` is the password for keystore
  defined in `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.alias` is the original certificate alias

**For `JCERACFKS` certificate (z/OS keyring) users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.owner` is the keyring owner. It's optional and
  default value is `zowe.setup.security.users.zowe`. If it's also not defined,

  * You can also customize `label` and `caLabel` under
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring` if you want to generate new certificate.
    Default value of `label` is `localhost` and default value of `caLabel` is
    `localca`.
- If you want to import certificate stored in MVS data set into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.dsName` is required in this case. It
    tells Zowe the data set where the certificate stored.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.password` is the password when
    importing the certificate.
  * The certificate will be imported with label defined in
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.label`.
- If you want to connect existing certificate into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.user` is required and tells Zowe
    the owner of existing certificate. This field can have value of `SITE`.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.label` is also required and tells

  is provided, Zowe will try to trust z/OSMF certificate.
  * If you are using `RACF` security manager, Zowe will try to automatically
    detect the z/OSMF CA based on certificate owner specified by
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.user`. Default value of this field is
    `IZUSVR`. If the automatic detection failed, you will need to define
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` indicates what is the label of
    z/OSMF root certificate authority.
  * If you are using `ACF2` or `TSS` (Top Secret) security manager,

  This field is required if VSAM mode is `RLS`.

- `zowe.verifyCertificates` indicates how Zowe should validate the certificate
  of services registered under Zowe APIML. Valid values are "STRICT",
  "NONSTRICT" or "DISABLED". If this is "STRICT", this command will try to
  validate the z/OSMF service certificate if z/OSMF is defined.

- `zOSMF.host` and `zOSMF.port` is the z/OSMF service information. This is
  required if you are using z/OSMF as authentication service.

- `components.caching-service.storage.mode` indicates what storage Zowe Caching
  Service will use. Only if this value is `VSAM`, this command will try to
  create VSAM data set.
- `components.caching-service.storage.vsam.name` defines the VSAM data set name.
