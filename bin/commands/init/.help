Init Zowe instance based on zowe.yaml configuration.

You can find an example zowe.yaml in Zowe runtime directory folder.

This command will run these sub-commands in sequence:

- `zwe init mvs`
- `zwe init vsam`
- `zwe init apfauth`
- `zwe init security`
- `zwe init certificate`
- `zwe init stc`

If you pass `--skip-security-setup` with this command, `zwe init apfauth` and
`zwe init security` steps will be skipped.

If you pass `--update-config` with this command, these configurations could
be written back to your Zowe YAML configuration file:

- `zowe.runtimeDirectory` based on where your `zwe` command is located, and if it
  is not defined,
- `zowe.certificate` based on your `zowe.setup.certificate` configuration,
- `java.home` based on your current JAVA_HOME or automatic detection,
- `node.home` based on your current NODE_HOME or automatic detection.

**IMPORTANT**, if you modify any of the values below, it's suggested to re-run
relevant `zwe init` command to make them taking effect.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are used:

**For `PKCS12` certificate users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.directory` is the directory where you plan to
  store the PKCS12 keystore and truststore. This is required if
  `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is `PKCS12`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.lock` is a boolean configuration to tell if we
  should lock the PKCS12 keystore directory only for Zowe runtime user and group.
  Default value is true.
- You can also define `name`, `password`, `caAlias` and `caPassword` under
  `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12` to customized keystore and truststore. These
  configurations are optional, but it is recommended to update them from
  default values.
- Define `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore` if you already acquired
  certificate from other CA, stored them in PKCS12 format, and want to import
  into Zowe PKCS12 keystore.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.password` is the password for keystore

    Default value of `label` is `localhost` and default value of `caLabel` is
    `localca`.
- If you want to import certificate stored in MVS data set into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.dsName` is required in this case. It
    tells Zowe the data set where the certificate stored.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.password` is the password when
    importing the certificate.
  * The certificate will be imported with label defined in
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.label`.
- If you want to connect existing certificate into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.user` is required and tells Zowe
    the owner of existing certificate. This field can have value of `SITE`.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.label` is also required and tells

  is provided, Zowe will try to trust z/OSMF certificate.
  * If you are using `RACF` security manager, Zowe will try to automatically
    detect the z/OSMF CA based on certificate owner specified by
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.user`. Default value of this field is
    `IZUSVR`. If the automatic detection failed, you will need to define
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` indicates what is the label of
    z/OSMF root certificate authority.
  * If you are using `ACF2` or `TSS` (Top Secret) security manager,

  This field is required if VSAM mode is `RLS`.

- `zowe.verifyCertificates` indicates how Zowe should validate the certificate
  of services registered under Zowe APIML. Valid values are "STRICT",
  "NONSTRICT" or "DISABLED". If this is "STRICT", this command will try to
  validate the z/OSMF service certificate if z/OSMF is defined.

- `zOSMF.host` and `zOSMF.port` is the z/OSMF service information. This is
  required if you are using z/OSMF as authentication service.

- `components.caching-service.storage.mode` indicates what storage Zowe Caching
  Service will use. Only if this value is `VSAM`, this command will try to
  create VSAM data set.
- `components.caching-service.storage.vsam.name` defines the VSAM data set name.
