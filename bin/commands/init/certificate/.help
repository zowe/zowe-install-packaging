This command will generate certificate used by Zowe services.

If you specify `--update-config` with this command, these configurations could
be written back to your Zowe YAML configuration file:

- `zowe.certificate` based on your `zowe.setup.certificate` configuration.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are used:

- `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is the type of certificate. Valid values are
  "PKCS12" (USS keystore) or "JCEKS", "JCECCAKS", "JCERACFKS", "JCECCARACFKS",
  and "JCEHYBRIDRACFKS (z/OS keyring).
- `zowe.setup.certificate.dname` is the distinguished name of the certificate.
  You can define `caCommonName`, `commonName`, `orgUnit`, `org`, `locality`,
  `state`, and / or `country`. These configurations are optional.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.validity` is the validity days of the certificate.
  This is optional.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.san` is the `Subject Alternative Name`(s) of the
  certificate if they are different from `zowe.externalDomains`. Please note,
  for `JCEKS`, `JCECCAKS`, `JCERACFKS`, `JCECCARACFKS`, and `JCEHYBRIDRACFKS`
  type, with limitation of RACDCERT command, this should contain exact one
  hostname (domain) and one IP address.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.importCertificateAuthorities` is the list of
  certificate authorities will be imported to Zowe PKCS12 keystore or
  keyring. Please note, for keyring type, only maximum 2 CAs is supported.
  If you are using `PKCS12` certificate, this should be USS files in PEM format.
  If you are using `JCEKS`, `JCECCAKS`, `JCERACFKS`, `JCECCARACFKS`, or
  `JCEHYBRIDRACFKS` certificate, this should be certificate labels
  on the z/OS system.
- `zOSMF.host` and `zOSMF.port` is the z/OSMF service information. This is
  required if you are using z/OSMF as authentication service.
- `zowe.verifyCertificates` indicates how Zowe should validate the certificate
  of services registered under Zowe APIML. Valid values are "STRICT",
  "NONSTRICT" or "DISABLED". If this is "STRICT", this command will try to
  validate the z/OSMF service certificate if z/OSMF is defined.

**For `PKCS12` certificate users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.directory` is the directory where you plan to
  store the PKCS12 keystore and truststore. This is required if
  `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is `PKCS12`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.lock` is a boolean configuration to tell if we
  should lock the PKCS12 keystore directory only for Zowe runtime user and group.
  Default value is true.
- `zowe.setup.security.groups.admin` and `zowe.setup.security.users.zowe` will
  be the default owner of keystore directory.
- You can also define `name`, `password`, `caAlias` and `caPassword` under
  `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12` to customized keystore and truststore. These
  configurations are optional, but it is recommended to update them from
  default values.
- Define `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore` if you already acquired
  certificate from other CA, stored them in PKCS12 format, and want to import
  into Zowe PKCS12 keystore.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.password` is the password for keystore
  defined in `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.alias` is the original certificate alias
  defined in `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.import.keystore`. After imported,
  the certificate will be saved as alias specified in
  `zowe.setup.certificate.pkcs12.name`.

**For keyring certificate users,**

- `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.owner` is the keyring owner. It's optional and
  default value is `zowe.setup.security.users.zowe`. If it's also not defined,
  the default value is `ZWESVUSR`.
- `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.name` is the keyring name will be created
  on z/OS. This is required if `zowe.setup.certificate.type` is one of `JCEKS`,
  `JCECCAKS`, `JCERACFKS`, `JCECCARACFKS`, or `JCEHYBRIDRACFKS`.
- If you want to let Zowe to generate new certificate,
  * You can also customize `label` and `caLabel` under
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring` if you want to generate new certificate.
    Default value of `label` is `localhost` and default value of `caLabel` is
    `localca`.
- If you want to import certificate stored in MVS data set into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.dsName` is required in this case. It
    tells Zowe the data set where the certificate stored.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.password` is the password when
    importing the certificate.
  * The certificate will be imported with label defined in
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.label`.
- If you want to connect existing certificate into Zowe keyring,
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.user` is required and tells Zowe
    the owner of existing certificate. This field can have value of `SITE`.
  * `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.connect.label` is also required and tells
    Zowe the label of existing certificate.
- If `zowe.verifyCertificates` is not `DISABLED`, and z/OSMF host (`zOSMF.host`)
  is provided, Zowe will try to trust z/OSMF certificate.
  * If you are using `RACF` security manager, Zowe will try to automatically
    detect the z/OSMF CA based on certificate owner specified by
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.user`. Default value of this field is
    `IZUSVR`. If the automatic detection failed, you will need to define
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` indicates what is the label of
    z/OSMF root certificate authority.
  * If you are using `ACF2` or `TSS` (Top Secret) security manager,
    `zowe.setup.certificate.keyring.zOSMF.ca` is required to indicates what is
    the label of z/OSMF root certificate authority.
