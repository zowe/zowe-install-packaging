Start Zowe with main started task.

These Zowe YAML configurations showing with sample values are used:

```yaml
zowe:
  setup:
    security:
      stcs:
        zowe: ZWESLSTC
  job:
    name: ZWE1SV
haInstances:
  [ha-instance]:
    sysname: ZLP1
```

- `zowe.setup.security.stcs.zowe` is Zowe started task name.
  This configuration is optional. Default value is `ZWESLSTC`.
- `zowe.job.name` is the optional customized job name to start Zowe. If it's
  empty, the start command will not pass `JOBNAME=` option to `S` command.
- `haInstances.[ha-instance].sysname` is the SYSNAME of the target HA instance.
  If you pass `--ha-instance` parameter, this is the SYSNAME the start command
  will be routed to.

Note: `zwe start` is only identifying an already configured instance of Zowe.
Any additional changes to the `zowe.yaml` config could possibly require
either manual changes or running related `zwe` commands before issuing `zwe start`.
