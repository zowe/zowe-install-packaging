# format is required.
# To generate component-level certificates, you can uncomment and modify the below line:
# COMPONENT_LEVEL_CERTIFICATES=gateway,app-server,zss
# If you are using external certificate for the component, please define these 2 variables in a format of
# <component>:<value>,<another-component>:<another-value>
