# Optional - you can generate dedicated certificate for each of the components or your extensions. Component-level

# The component-level certificates can be used to authenticate against Caching Service, and this is recommended how to
# configure your instance in High Availalibity deployment. To use component-level certificates, using YAML configuration
# format is required.
# To generate component-level certificates, you can uncomment and modify the below line:
# COMPONENT_LEVEL_CERTIFICATES=gateway,app-server,zss
# If you are using external certificate for the component, please define these 2 variables in a format of
# <component>:<value>,<another-component>:<another-value>
# optional - Path to a PKCS12 keystore with a server certificate for component
# For example: gateway:/path/to/my/external/certificate/keystore.p12,app-server:/path/to/my/external/certificate/keystore.p12
# EXTERNAL_COMPONENT_CERTIFICATES=
# optional - Alias of the component certificate in the keystore.
