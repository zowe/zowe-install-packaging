# Kubernetes YAML Configurations

**NOTES:** all paths below are relative to current directory `containers/kubernetes`.
<br /> <br />

## Prerequisites

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster

Zowe containerization solution is compatible with Kubernetes v1.19+ or OpenShift v4.6+.

There are many ways to prepare a Kubernetes cluster based on your requirements.

For development purpose, you can setup a Kubernetes cluster on your local computer by:

- [enabling Kubernetes shipped with Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/)
- or [setting up minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

For production purpose, you can:

- bootstrap your own cluster by following this official document [Installing Kubernetes with deployment tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/).
- or provision a Kubernetes cluster from popular Cloud vendors:
  - [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
  - [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)
  - [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/cloud/kubernetes-service)
  - [Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)

### 2. `kubectl` Tool

You need `kubectl` CLI tool installed on your local computer where you want to manage the Kubernetes cluster. Please follow appropriate steps from official documentation [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).
<br /> <br />

## Preparations

This section assumes you already have a Kubernetes cluster setup and have `kubectl` tool installed.

### 1. Create Namespace and Service Account

Run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f common/zowe-ns.yaml && kubectl apply -f common/zowe-sa.yaml
```

Our default namespace is `zowe`, default service account name is `zowe-sa`. Please note that by default, `zowe-sa` service account has `automountServiceAccountToken` disabled for security purpose.

To verify this step, run:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

and it should show a Namespace `zowe`;

then run:

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts --namespace zowe
```

and it should show a ServiceAccount `zowe-sa`.

### 2. Create Persistent Volume Claim

Open [samples/workspace-pvc.yaml](samples/workspace-pvc.yaml), Double check `storageClassName` value (line 24) and replace `hostpath` to customize to your own value. You can run

```bash
kubectl get sc
```

to list all StorageClasses on your cluster. A sample output will look like this:

```bash
  NAME                 PROVISIONER                RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
  standard (default)   k8s.io/example-hostpath    Delete          Immediate           false                  29m
```

Following the example above, your `storageClassName` line in `workspace-pvc.yaml` should be `storageClassName: standard`. Note that this is just an example, you should have a different storageClassName value based on your specific environment.

After making all necessary changes, run the following command to apply:

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/workspace-pvc.yaml
```

To verify this step, run

```bash
kubectl get pvc --namespace zowe
```

and it should show a PersistentVolumeClaim `zowe-workspace-pvc`, and the `STATUS` should be `Bound`.

### 3. Create And Modify ConfigMaps and Secrets

Same as running Zowe on z/OS, you can use either `instance.env` or `zowe.yaml` to customize Zowe. You can modify `samples/config-cm.yaml`, `samples/certificates-cm.yaml` and `samples/certificates-secret.yaml` directly. Or more conveniently, if you have Zowe ZSS/ZIS running on z/OS, you can run `<instance-dir>/bin/utils/convert-for-k8s.sh` to migrate configurations for Kubernetes deployment:

```bash
cd <instance-dir>
./bin/utils/convert-for-k8s.sh -x "my-k8s-cluster.company.com,9.10.11.12"
```

This migration script supports these parameters:

- `-x`: is the list of domains you will use to visit Zowe Kubernetes cluster separated by comma. These domains and IP addresses will be added to your new certificate if needed. This is optional, default value is `localhost`.
- `-n`: is the Zowe Kubernetes cluster namespace. This is optional, default value is `zowe`.
- `-u`: is the Kubernetes cluster name. This is optional, default value is `cluster.local`.
- `-p`: is the password of local certificate authority PKCS#12 file. This is optional, default value is `local_ca_password`.
- `-a`: is the certificate alias of local certificate authority. This is optional, default value is `localca`.
- `-v`: is a switch to enable verbose mode which will display more debugging information.

As a result, this script will display a set of YAML format content of `zowe-config` ConfigMap, `zowe-certificates-cm` ConfigMap (if you are using `instance.env`) and `zowe-certificates-secret` Secret. Follow the instruction on script output to copy the output and save as a YAML file `configs.yaml` on your server that you have set up kubernetes, next run following command to apply configurations:

```bash
kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/configs.yaml
```

Upon success, you should see the following output: `configmap/zowe-config created`, `configmap/zowe-certificates-cm created`, and `secret/zowe-certificates-secret created`.

If you want to manually define `zowe-config` ConfigMap based on your `instance.env`, please notice these differences comparing running on z/OS:

- `ZOWE_EXPLORER_HOST`, `ZOWE_IP_ADDRESS`, `ZWE_LAUNCH_COMPONENTS`, `ZWE_DISCOVERY_SERVICES_LIST` and `SKIP_NODE` are not needed for Zowe running in Kubernetes and will be ignored. You can remove them.
- `JAVA_HOME` and `NODE_HOME` are not usually needed if you are using Zowe base images.
- `ROOT_DIR` must be set to `/home/zowe/runtime`.
- `KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY` must be set to `/home/zowe/keystore`. This is not needed if you are using `zowe.yaml`.
- `ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS` is suggested to define as a list domains you are using to access your Kubernetes cluster.
- `ZOWE_EXTERNAL_HOST=$(echo "${ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS}" | awk -F, '{print $1}' | tr -d '[[:space:]]')` is needed to define after `ZWE_EXTERNAL_HOSTS`. It's the primary external domain.
- `ZWE_EXTERNAL_PORT` (or `zowe.externalPort` if you are using `zowe.yaml`) must be the port you expose to end-user. This value is optional if it's same as default `GATEWAY_PORT` `7554`. With default settings,
  * if you choose `LoadBalancer` `gateway-service`, this value is optional, or set to `7554`,
  * if you choose `NodePort` `gateway-service` and access the service directly, this value should be same as `spec.ports[0].nodePort` with default value `32554`,
  * if you choose `NodePort` `gateway-service` and access the service through port forwarding, the value should be the forwarded port you set.
- `ZOWE_ZOS_HOST` is recommended to be set to where the z/OS system where your Zowe ZSS/ZIS is running.
- `ZWE_DISCOVERY_SERVICES_REPLICAS` should be set to same value of `spec.replicas` defined in `workloads/instance-env/discovery-statefulset.yaml` or `workloads/zowe-yaml/discovery-statefulset.yaml`.
- All components running in Kubernetes should use default ports:
  - `CATALOG_PORT` is `7552`,
  - `DISCOVERY_PORT` is `7553`,
  - `GATEWAY_PORT` is `7554`,
  - `ZWE_CACHING_SERVICE_PORT` is `7555`,
  - `JOBS_API_PORT` is `8545`,
  - `FILES_API_PORT` is `8547`,
  - `JES_EXPLORER_UI_PORT` is `8546`,
  - `MVS_EXPLORER_UI_PORT` is `8548`,
  - `USS_EXPLORER_UI_PORT` is `8550`,
  - `ZOWE_ZLUX_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT` is `8544`.
- `ZOWE_ZSS_SERVER_PORT` should be set to the port where your Zowe ZSS is running on `ZOWE_ZOS_HOST`.
- `APIML_GATEWAY_EXTERNAL_MAPPER` should be set to `https://${GATEWAY_HOST}:${GATEWAY_PORT}/zss/api/v1/certificate/x509/map`.
- `APIML_SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT_URL` should be set to `https://${GATEWAY_HOST}:${GATEWAY_PORT}/zss/api/v1/saf-auth`.
- `ZOWE_EXPLORER_FRAME_ANCESTORS` should be set to `${ZOWE_EXTERNAL_HOST}:*`
- `ZWE_CACHING_SERVICE_PERSISTENT` should NOT be set to `VSAM`. `redis` is suggested. Follow [Redis configuration](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-redis/#redis-configuration) documentation to customize other redis related variables. Leave the value to empty for debugging purpose.
- Must append and customize these 2 values:
  - `ZWED_agent_host=${ZOWE_ZOS_HOST}` is telling App-Server the z/OS system when ZSS and ZIS components are running.
  - `ZWED_agent_https_port=${ZOWE_ZSS_SERVER_PORT}`

If you are using `zowe.yaml`, the above instructions are still valid, but should use the matching `zowe.yaml` configuration entries. Check [Updating the zowe.yaml configuration file](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/user-guide/configure-instance-directory/#updating-the-zoweyaml-configuration-file) for more details.

To verify this step, run:

```bash
kubectl get configmaps --namespace zowe
```

and it should show two ConfigMaps `zowe-config` and `zowe-certificates-cm`.
Run:

```bash
kubectl get secrets --namespace zowe
```

and it should show a Secret `zowe-certificates-secret`.

### 4. Expose API Catalog, Gateway and Discovery

This section is highly related to your Kubernetes cluster configuration. If you are not sure about these sections, please contact your Kubernetes administrator or us.

#### 4a. Create Services

You may choose between `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` service depending on your Kubernetes provider. Please note `NodePort` services should be avoided as they are insecure, and can not be used together with `NetworkPolicies`. `LoadBalancers` or use of an `Ingress` is recommended over `NodePorts`.

The table below provides a guidance for you:
<a id="table"></a>
| Kubernetes provider       | Service                  | Additional setups required                                 |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------  | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| minikube                  | LoadBalancer or NodePort | [Port Forward](#4b-port-forward-for-minikube-only)         |
| docker-desktop            | LoadBalancer             | none                                                       |
| bare-metal                | LoadBalancer or NodePort | [Create Ingress](#4c-create-ingress-for-bare-metal-only)   |
| cloud-vendors             | LoadBalancer             | none                                                       |
| OpenShift                 | LoadBalancer or NodePort | [Create Route](#4d-create-route-for-openshift-only)        |

__Note__: Complete current section "4a. Create Service section" first, then work on additional setups listed in the table above if necessary.

##### <ins>Define api-catalog service</ins>

`api-catalog-service` is required by Zowe, but not necessarily exposed to external users. So `api-catalog-service` is defined as type `ClusterIP`. To define this service, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/api-catalog-service.yaml
```

Upon success, you should see following output: `service/api-catalog-service created`

##### <ins>Expose gateway service</ins>

- If you choose `LoadBalancer` service, run:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f samples/gateway-service-lb.yaml
    ```

- If you choose `NodePort` services,
  - First check `spec.ports[0].nodePort` as this will be the port to be exposed to external. The default gateway port is __not__ `7554` but `32554`. You can use `https://<your-k8s-node>:32554/` to access APIML Gateway.
  - Then run:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f samples/gateway-service-np.yaml
    ```

Either way, upon success, you should see following output: `service/gateway-service created`

##### <ins>Expose discovery service</ins>

Exposing discovery service is mandatory when there is zowe component running on z/OS side (outside of kubernetes) and requires doing dynamic registration.

If you choose to enable, simply run the following step:

- If using `LoadBalancer`, run:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f samples/discovery-service-lb.yaml
  ```

- If using `NodePort`, run:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f samples/discovery-service-np.yaml
  ```

However, if you choose not to expose discovery service, you must do one extra step before applying above command.
Depending on `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` used, in [discovery-service-lb.yaml](samples/discovery-service-lb.yaml) or [discovery-service-np.yaml](samples/discovery-service-np.yaml) (line 15), specify `ClusterIP` as type. Then apply discovery-service yaml file depending on what service you are using (see above).

Upon success, you shall see `service/discovery-service created`.

<br>
To verify above steps, run

```bash
kubectl get services --namespace zowe
```

and it should show services `api-catalog-service`, `gateway-service` and `discovery-service`.

Upon completion of this 4a. Create Service section, you would probably need to run additional setups. Refer to "Additional setups required" in the table. [Return to table](#table)
If you don't need additional setups, you can skip 4b, 4c, 4d and jump directly to [Apply Zowe](#apply-zowe-core-components-workloads-and-start-zowe) section.

#### 4b. Port Forward (for minikube only)

Run following two commands to enable port-forward:

```bash
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 --namespace zowe service/gateway-service 7554:7554 &
```

and

```bash
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 --namespace zowe service/discovery-service 7553:7553 &
```

Note: Because kubectl port-forward is running in foreground, because we have more commands to run in next steps, so we need to run in background here.

Upon completion, next [apply zowe](#apply-zowe-core-components-workloads-and-start-zowe).

#### 4c. Create Ingress (for bare-metal only)

Before applying, here are a series of steps to do:
- Open files [samples/bare-metal/gateway-ingress.yaml](samples/bare-metal/gateway-ingress.yaml) and [samples/bare-metal/discovery-ingress.yaml](samples/bare-metal/discovery-ingress.yaml),
- Go to line 19 `spec.rules[0].host`,
- Uncomment line 19 and 20,
- Fill in the value of host on line 19,
- Comment out line 21

Then:

```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/bare-metal/gateway-ingress.yaml && kubectl apply -f samples/bare-metal/discovery-ingress.yaml
```

To verify this step,

- `kubectl get ingresses --namespace zowe` should show Ingresses `gateway-ingress` and `discovery-ingress`.

Upon completion, next [apply zowe](#apply-zowe-core-components-workloads-and-start-zowe).

#### 4d. Create Route (for OpenShift only)

If you are using OpenShift, usually you need to define `Route` instead of `Ingress`.

Open files [samples/openshift/gateway-route.yaml](samples/openshift/gateway-route.yaml) and [samples/openshift/discovery-route.yaml](samples/openshift/discovery-route.yaml), double check the value of `spec.port.targetPort` (line 18). Then run:

```bash
oc apply -f samples/openshift/gateway-route.yaml && oc apply -f samples/openshift/discovery-route.yaml
```

To verify this step, run:

```bash
oc get routes --namespace zowe
```

and it should show two Services `gateway` and `discovery`.
Upon completion, next [apply zowe](#apply-zowe-core-components-workloads-and-start-zowe).
<br /><br /><br />

## Apply Zowe Core Components Workloads and Start Zowe

Depends on whether you are using `instance.env` or `zowe.yaml` to start Zowe, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f workloads/instance-env/
```

or,

```bash
kubectl apply -f workloads/zowe-yaml/
```

To verify this step, run:

```bash
kubectl get deployments --namespace zowe
```

It should show you a list of deployments including `explorer-jes`, `explorer-mvs`, `explorer-uss`, `files-api`, `jobs-api`, and etc. Wait for a bit as it takes time to bring each deployment up; time varies depending on your machine environment.
Upon success, eventually each deployment should show `1/1` in `READY` column.

Run:

```bash
kubectl get statefulsets --namespace zowe
```

should show you a StatefulSet `discovery` which `READY` column should be `1/1`.

Run:

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs --namespace zowe
```

should show you a CronJob `cleanup-static-definitions` which `SUSPEND` should be `False`.
<br /><br /><br />

## Access Zowe

If you are using `LoadBalancer`, Zowe instance is accessible through port 7554: `https://\<ip-address\>:7554`
<br /><br /><br />

## Import New Component

### 1. Build and Push Component Image

Component must create container image and the component image must follow Zowe Containerization Conformance to make sure it can be started within a Zowe cluster.

Zowe core components define component Dockerfiles and use Github Actions to build images. For example, `explorer-jes` component

- has Dockerfile defined at <https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/blob/master/container/Dockerfile>,
- and defines Github Actions workflow <https://github.com/zowe/explorer-jes/blob/master/.github/workflows/explorer-jes-images.yml> to build the image.

There are several shared Github Actions may help you build your own image:

- `zowe-actions/shared-actions/docker-prepare` will prepare required environment variables used by following steps.
- `zowe-actions/shared-actions/docker-build-local` can build docker image directory on Github Actions virtual machine. By default it will be `ubuntu-latest`. This action can be used to build image for `amd64` CPU architecture.
- `zowe-actions/shared-actions/docker-build-zlinux` can build docker image on a `Linux on Z` virtual machine. This is useful if you want to build image for `s390x` CPU architecture.
- `zowe-actions/shared-actions/docker-manifest` can collect all related images and define them as docker manifests. This is useful for end-user to automatically pull the correct image based on cluster node CPU architecture, and also pull images based on popular tags like `latest`, `latest-ubuntu`, etc.

Component image must be pushed to a container image registry.

### 2. Define `Deployment` Object

In order to start your component in Kubernetes, you need to define a `Deployment` object. To define `Deployment` for your component, you can copy from `samples/sample-deployment.yaml` and modify all occurrences of these variables:

- `<my-component-name>`: this is your component name. For example, `sample-node-api`.
- `<my-component-image>`: this is your component image described in the above [section](#build-and-push-component-image). For example, `zowe-docker-release.jfrog.io/ompzowe/sample-node-api:latest-ubuntu`.
- `<my-component-port>`: this is the port of your service. For example, `8080`.

Continue to customize the specification to fit in your component requirements:

- `spec.replicas`: adjust how many pods you wish to start for your component,
- `spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources`: adjust the memory and CPU resource required to start the container,
- `metadata.annotations`, `spec.template.spec.volumes` and `spec.template.spec.securityContext` etc.

### 3. Start Your Component

Once you defined your component `Deployment` object, you can run `kubectl apply -f /path/to/your/component-deployment.yaml` to apply it to Kubernetes cluster running Zowe. Now you can follow common Kubernetes practice to mange your component workload.
<br /><br /><br />

## Configuration, Operation

When Zowe workload running in Kubernetes cluster, it follows common Kubernetes operation recommendations.

### 1. Monitoring Zowe Workload Running In Kubernetes

There are many ways to monitor workload running in Kubernetes, Kubernetes Dashboard could be a quick choice. Please follow this [Deploy and Access the Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/) instruction.

If you are using a development Kubernetes shipped with Docker Desktop, the dashboard is already installed and `kubernetes-dashboard` namespace is already configuration.

[Metrics Server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) is also recommended and is required if you want to define [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/). Check if you have `metrics-server` `Service` in `kube-system` namespace with this command `kubectl get services --namespace kube-system`. If you don't have, you can follow this [Installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#installation) instruction to install.

### 2. Pause, Resume Or Remove Component

To temporarily stop a component, you can find the component `Deployment` and scale down to `0`. To use `jobs-api` as example, run this command:

```bash
kubectl scale -n zowe deployment jobs-api --replicas=0
```

Scaling the component back to 1 or more to re-enable the component.

If you want to permanently remove a component, you can delete the component `Deployment`. To use `jobs-api` as example, run this command:

```bash
kubectl delete -n zowe deployment jobs-api
```

### 3. `PodDisruptionBudget`

Zowe provides default `PodDisruptionBudget` which can help on providing high availability during upgrade. By default, Zowe defines `minAvailable` to be `1` for all deployments. This configuration is optional but recommended. To apply `PodDisruptionBudget`, run this command:

```
kubectl apply -f samples/pod-disruption-budget/
```

To verify this step, run:

```bash
kubectl get pdb --namespace zowe
```

should show you list of `PodDisruptionBudget` like this:

```
NAME               MIN AVAILABLE   MAX UNAVAILABLE   ALLOWED DISRUPTIONS   AGE
api-catalog-pdb    1               N/A               0                     1d
app-server-pdb     1               N/A               0                     1d
caching-pdb        1               N/A               0                     1d
discovery-pdb      1               N/A               0                     1d
explorer-jes-pdb   1               N/A               0                     1d
explorer-mvs-pdb   1               N/A               0                     1d
explorer-uss-pdb   1               N/A               0                     1d
files-api-pdb      1               N/A               0                     1d
gateway-pdb        1               N/A               0                     1d
jobs-api-pdb       1               N/A               0                     1d
```

### 4. `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`

Zowe provides default `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` which can help on automatically scaling Zowe components based on resource usage. By default, each workload has minimal 1 replica and maximum 3 to 5 replicas based on CPU usage. This configuration is optional but recommended. `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` relies on Kubernetes [Metrics server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) monitoring to provide metrics through the [Metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics). To learn how to deploy the metrics-server, see the [metrics-server documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server#deployment). Please adjust the `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` definitions based on your cluster resources, then run this command to apply them to your cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f samples/horizontal-pod-autoscaler/
```

To verify this step, run:

```bash
kubectl get hpa --namespace zowe
```

should show you list of `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` like this:

```
NAME               REFERENCE                 TARGETS   MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
api-catalog-hpa    Deployment/api-catalog    60%/70%   1         3         1          20m

```

### 5. Kubernetes v1.21+

If you have Kubernetes v1.21+, there are few changes recommended based on [Deprecated API Migration Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/).

- Kind `CronJob`: change `apiVersion: batch/v1beta1` to `apiVersion: batch/v1` on `workloads/zowe-yaml/cleanup-static-definitions-cronjob.yaml` and `workloads/instance-env/cleanup-static-definitions-cronjob.yaml`. `apiVersion: batch/v1beta1` will stop working on Kubernetes v1.25.
- Kind `PodDisruptionBudget`: change `apiVersion: policy/v1beta1` to `apiVersion: policy/v1` on all files in `samples/pod-disruption-budget/`. `apiVersion: policy/v1beta1` will stop working on Kubernetes v1.25.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### ISSUE: `/tmp` Directory Is Not Writable

We enabled `readOnlyRootFilesystem` SecurityContext by default in `Deployment` object definition. This will result in `/tmp` is readonly and not writable to `zowe` runtime user.

**Recommended fix:**

Adjust your component to check `TMPDIR` or `TMP` environment variable to determine location of the temporary directory. Zowe runtime customizes those variables and points them to `/home/zowe/instance/tmp` directory, which is writable.

**Alternative fix:**

Disabling `readOnlyRootFilesystem` SecurityContext is not recommended. But you can make `/tmp` writable by replacing it with a new mounted volume. Here is an example of defining `/tmp` volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: tmp
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: <my-component-name>
          volumeMounts:
            - name: tmp
              mountPath: "/tmp"
```

With this added to your `Deployment`, your component should be able to write to `/tmp` directory.

## Launch Single Image On Local Computer Without Kubernetes

**NOTES,** this is for debugging purpose and it's not recommended for end-user.

### 1. Init `tmp` Folder

- Create `tmp` folder:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p tmp
  cd tmp
  ```

- Init with `zowe-launch-scripts` image:

  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/home/zowe zowe-docker-snapshot.jfrog.io/ompzowe/zowe-launch-scripts:1.25.0-ubuntu.staging
  ```

- Create `tmp/instance/instance.env` with your desired content. This content you can modify from `samples/config-cm.yaml`.
- Create `tmp/keystore/` and `tmp/keystore/zowe-certificates.env` with your desired content.

### 2. Start Component Container

For example, starting `explorer-jes` with `bash`:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/zowe \
    --entrypoint /bin/bash \
    zowe-docker-release.jfrog.io/ompzowe/explorer-jes:latest
```

Or try to start the component:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/home/zowe \
    --entrypoint /bin/bash \
    zowe-docker-release.jfrog.io/ompzowe/explorer-jes:latest \
    -- /home/zowe/instance/bin/internal/run-zowe.sh
```
