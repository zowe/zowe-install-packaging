## Repository Overview

The zowe-install-packaging repository contains multiple technologies and workflows focused around the packaging, delivery, installation and configuration of Zowe server-side components. Since this repository's scope reaches from simply collecting other Zowe server components ([manifest](../manifest.json.template)) to configuration via USS CLI command tooling ([zwe](../bin/zwe)), it's typical to receive pull requests and code modifications from multiple squads within Zowe. Unlike many of the other repositories in Zowe which are primarily driven by a single squad, the zowe-install-packaging repository is collaboratively maintained. The Zowe Systems Squad is the primary administrator and point of contact if you have any questions or issues.

### Structure

This repository contains a mix of packaging/install/configuration, e2e testing, and automation materials. The [repository index](#repository-index) gives a discrete view of this repository's contents, but the contents can be organized roughly into:

* Packaging automation and tools. The `.pax`, `containers`, `files`, `pswi`, `smpe`, and `workflows` directories all cover different aspects of packaging, covered later under [Distribution Formats](#distribution-formats).
* End-user install and configuration tooling. The `bin` (a.k.a. zwe command-line tool), `schemas`, and `workflows` folders all represent tooling intended for use by end-users during their install and configuration of Zowe. This will be covered under [Install and Configuration](#install-and-configuration).
* Zowe Build, Test, and other Automation. The `.dependency`, `.github`, `build`, `playbooks`, `signing_keys`, `tests` folders and `manifest.json.template` file are all part of Zowe pipelines. This will be covered under [Infrastructure, Pipelines, and Automation](#infrastructure-pipelines-automation).


### Manifest Metadata

The manifest is a critical point of Zowe's build and release process. Zowe is composed of individual components which are built in other repositories, by other Zowe squads, in different languages, with different binary formats. `manifest.json.template` is a specification that defines which components are included in an official build, where said components located in remote registries, and some general information regarding the current build of Zowe.

The manifest file covers:

- [General Information](#general-information)
- [Build Information](#build-information)
- [Binary Dependencies](#binary-dependencies)
- [Source Dependencies (Provenance)](#source-dependencies)
- [Container Image Dependencies](#image-dependencies)
- [Deprecated Fields](#deprecated-fields)

#### General information

This section consists of these properties: `name`, `version`, `description`, `license` and `homepage`.

#### Build information

This `build` section includes details when building the Zowe artifact. During the build process, `manifest.json.template` will be converted to `manifest.json` and template variables (e.g. `{BUILD_COMMIT_HASH}`) will be populated with real values. The modified `manifest.json` will then be placed into root folder of Zowe build and picked up by downstream automation.

Here is an example of build information after build, you can find it in the `manifest.json` file from every Zowe build:

```
  "build": {
    "branch": "staging",
    "number": "202",
    "commitHash": "dad00f0a9c45f34bfbe3ec56a8443f2e818e59f4",
    "timestamp": "1568205429441"
  },
```

The above build information means this Zowe build is from `staging` branch build #202, git commit hash is [dad00f0a9c45f34bfbe3ec56a8443f2e818e59f4](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/commit/dad00f0a9c45f34bfbe3ec56a8443f2e818e59f4). Build time is `1568205429441`, which means `Wed Sep 11 2019 08:37:09 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)`.

#### Binary Dependencies

The `binaryDependencies` section defines which components will be included into the binary build. Each component has an unique ID, which hints where the pipeline should pick up the component artifact. Also for each the component, it defines which version will be included into the build. The version follows the Artifactory file spec format for resolving special characters, such as wildcards.

Here is an example of component definition:

```
    "org.zowe.explorer.jobs": {
      "version": "~0.2.8-STAGING",
      "explode": "true"
    }
```

`org.zowe.explorer.jobs` is the component ID, which also tell the pipeline to pick the component from Artifactory path `<repo>/org/zowe/explorer/jobs/`. `version` defines which version we should pick. In this case, we should pick the max version matches `0.2.*-STAGING` and `>= 0.2.8-STAGING`. So version `0.2.10-STAGING` is a good match if it exists.

For details of **how to define a component**, please check examples and explanations from https://zowe.github.io/jenkins-library/jenkins_shared_library/artifact/JFrogArtifactory.html#interpretArtifactDefinition(java.lang.String,%20java.util.Map,%20java.util.Map).

#### Source Dependencies

The `sourceDependencies` section defines how the component binary matches to the Zowe github repository, branch or tag. Matching repositories are not automatically validated, so squads must keep `sourceDependencies` up-to-date to reflect the component binary matches. The `sourceDependencies` section is grouped by `componentGroup` to logically connect source repositories into coarser components. For example, `Zowe Application Framework` componentGroup includes all repositories related it and listed in `entries` section.

One example component entry looks like:

```
  {
    "repository": "imperative",
    "tag": "v2.4.9"
  }
```

This means the Zowe build is using https://github.com/zowe/imperative repository tag [v2.4.9](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/tree/v2.4.9).

**Please note, this section may not reflect the correct value for nightly or informal releases.** Only for formal releases, we will update these sections to match the correct repository tags.

To check for each release, what source code from repositories will be used, you can:

- go to https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging,
- click on [?? releases](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/releases),
- find the release name. For example [v1.4.0](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/releases/tag/v1.4.0),
- click on the tag name on the left. In the above case, it shows [v1.4.0](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/tree/v1.4.0),
- find and check file `manifest.json.template`. In the above case, it links to [v1.4.0/manifest.json.template](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-install-packaging/blob/v1.4.0/manifest.json.template).
- check the `sourceDependencies` section. In the above case, it's line #96.
- In the above example, you will see Zowe release v1.4.0 is using https://github.com/zowe/imperative repository tag [v2.4.9](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/tree/v2.4.9).

#### Image Dependencies

The `imageDependencies` section tracks the container artifacts used as part of distribution of Zowe for Kubernetes. The sources for the container builds are part of this repository, under the [containers](#containers) section. One image entry looks like:

```
    "base": {
        "registry": "zowe-docker-release.jfrog.io",
        "name": "ompzowe/base",
        "tag" : "2.0-ubuntu"
    }
```

#### Deprecated Fields

The following fields are deprecated in the manifest file, and not used at any point by downstream automation or end-users.

- `dependencyDecisions` was an attempt to track dependency status for all of Zowe represented in the manifest; deprecated in favor of other more popular scanning tools.
```
  "dependencyDecisions": {
    "rel": ".dependency/doc/dependency_decisions.yml"
  }
```

### Branch Strategy

The zowe-install-packaging repository is the convergence point for Zowe's component integrations and release activities and so must be able to support both rapid iteration from multiple component squads testing their latest code and respective integrations, as well as support component and code stability during release windows across multiple release lines. Our branching, build, and release strategies are defined to meet those requirements.

- The `vN.x/staging` branch is the active development branch for the `vN` release line, and creates builds on a nightly basis. This branch typically creates stable builds but may occasionally generate an unstable build, as this branch is configured to automatically pickup new component builds. By default, all development changes should be opened as Pull Requests against this branch.
- The `vN.x/rc` branches are used to create release candidates and stabilize them. It's an intermediate state where we finalize and harden the code to prepare for the coming release. This branch is updated from `vN.x/staging` in preparation for a release with locked-in component artifacts, and is occasionally further updated in response to feedback on generated release candidates. Once the Zowe TSC votes to promote a release candidate, this branch will be merged into `vN.x/master` as the latest official release. 
- From any `vN.x/master` branch, you can find the most recent **official** build within the Zowe `vN` release line. e.g., official Zowe v2 releases can be found in `v2.x/master`. Every official build also generates a tag in the `zowe-install-packaging` repository. When an official release is produced, `vN.x/master` is merged back into `vN.x/staging` to ensure capture of any changes which went into `vN.x/rc`.
- All other branches are considered work-in-progress. We suggest using a naming structure which makes both their intent and ownership clear. e.g., something like `user/[myusername]/[feature-or-effective-change]` or `feat/[group-name]/[feature-description-or-issue-#]`, but we don't require any particular structure.


### Testing

Automated e2e tests are driven from the [./tests](../tests) folder in the repository, which contains two testing suites - installation and sanity - each with multiple test cases. In general, individual installation test cases require the most time to complete and sanity tests are always run after an installation test case as part of the automation. Install test cases setup ansible variables and then invoke ansible playbooks to deploy Zowe onto a target backend system with a few pre-configured ansible variables. The ansible playbooks can be found in the [./playbooks](../playbooks/) directory and detailed documentation can be found [in the playbooks README](../playbooks/README.md).

Zowe runs nightly builds against every staging branch which has an active development or maintenance release line, e.g. `v2.x/staging` and `v3.x/staging` for `v2` and `v3` respectively. The nightly builds create PAX and SMP/e distributions of Zowe, and runs both a PAX installation test and an SMP/e installation test on all our mainframe systems with the nightly build artifacts. Once weekly, an extended test suite is run which covers additional scenarios, which notably includes keyring tests.


## Infrastructure, Pipelines, and Automation

The Zowe community builds distributable, executable artifacts in addition to the source code present in the github organization. In order to produce these artifacts, the community needs infrastructure and automation tailored to work with mainframe systems. This section covers what we're building, where we're building it, and how it's built. 

All of Zowe's automation runs on Github Actions, and most of the automation leverages functionality present in the [zowe-actions github organization](https://github.com/zowe-actions/). Key functionality from that GH organization includes the capability to transfer files to a mainframe backend in either binary or ASCII mode, as well as execute build scripts on the mainframe backend. 
All of Zowe's GHA content is defined under the standard [.github](../.github/workflows/) folder. You can review each individual workflow for more information; some workflows will be covered in this document.

### Infrastructure

Zowe relies heavily on three backend mainframe systems managed exclusively through the Systems Squad. These systems run recent releases of z/OS with each of the respective mainframe security managers (RACF,TSS,ACF2), and have commonly used and freely available software installed, such as Java, Node.JS, etc. All of Zowe's builds which require a mainframe to complete - which is typically compilation of platform-specific code or platform-specific packaging activities - are run on one of these three systems. Most builds round robin between the systems to spread out load; some few rely on a single system for a particular feature. These systems are _not_ for public use.

Zowe also relies on z/Linux instances, which are used primarily for container pipelines which create s390x compatible images. See [Containers](#containers) for more information on containers built by Zowe.

Zowe has very limited distributed infrastructure and does not currently require it; relying on the runners provided by Github Actions to drive our automation has been sufficient. 

We use a cloud Artifactory instance to publish and retrieve artifacts for use across pipelines. It's not common to see build artifacts attached as GHA artifacts since they're uploaded to Artifactory, and instead we publish build logs and test results to the GHA output.

### Build and Test

Zowe's Build and Test automation is defined by two key workflows: the [Zowe Build and Packaging Workflow](../.github/workflows/build-packaging.yml), and the [Zowe CICD Integration Tests Workflow](../.github/workflows/cicd-test.yml). Both of these workflows can be triggered manually by a repository committer, and both are run automatically as part of any pull request which targets a protected base branch. We cannot build Zowe in parallel on a single system, so whenever a build is running on a given system, for any distribution selected, that system is locked for the duration of the build to prevent concurrent builds.

The build and packaging workflow is responsible for creating [distributions of Zowe](#distribution-formats) by collecting Zowe's individual components through the [manifest.json](#manifest-metadata). By default, the build and packaging workflow only creates a PAX file; creating an SMP/e or PSWI build requires a manual build or [a PR label](#using-pr-labels). 

The build workflow makes heavy use of `zowe-actions`, and relies on a set of scripts defined in a `.pax` folder within the repository, which executes a series of scripts in order:

1. `prepare-workspace.sh` - Script run on the build machine (Github Actions), which sets up the local filesystem to transfer files to the backend machine. 
2. `pre-packaging.sh` - Script run on the backend machine before the pax is assembled.
3. `post-packaging.sh` - Script run on the backend machine after the pax is assembled.
4. `catchall-packaging.sh` - Script run on the build machine after all other actions. Always runs, even if an earlier script failed.

Together, these scripts are responsible for creating the Zowe PAX file. If the build is set to create an SMP/e build, then the `post-packaging.sh` script will invoke scripts under the `smpe` directory, which create SMP/e installable media from the PAX file. If the build is set to create a PSWI distribution, the SMP/e build is first created (this is automatically enabled by automation, even when the SMP/e option is unset). After the SMP/e build is complete, the Github Action workflow will run the PSWI scripts from the `pswi` folder (`pswi/PSWI-marist.sh`) to create the distribution.

The Zowe CICD Test workflow is responsible for taking previously built Zowe artifacts and running a sanity test suite against them. In order to run the sanity test suite, the pre-built Zowe artifacts first need to be installed, and this is where a majority of our automation is focused - on repeated installation of Zowe artifacts for the PAX and SMP/e distributions, including installations with different configuration parameters set. (The PSWI distribution does not have an automated install, as there is no API surface for driving the installation actions). All CICD tests suites are collected under the [tests](../tests/) folder. 

When the Zowe CICD Test workflow is run manually through `workflow_dispatch`, the automation requires information about which Zowe artifact to test. This can be provided as either an artifactory pattern to a folder with build artifacts, e.g. `libs-snapshot-local/org/zowe/2.15.0-MY-PR/`, or more conveniently a `Zowe Build and Packaging Workflow` build number, e.g. `4688`, which references the Github Action workflow number that created a PAX or SMP/e artifact.
When the Zowe CICD Test workflow is run automatically, it's as part of an extended Build and Packaging workflow where the Zowe artifact information is provided to the CICD Test workflow under the hood. This automatic run happens on any push to a pull request which is targeting a protected base branch, or as part of our nightly build and test suite.

The installation tests, or automated installs of Zowe, all leverage Ansible playbooks to drive the actions on the mainframe. To read more about the Ansible playbooks and their construction, see the [playbook README](../playbooks/README.md).

#### Using PR Labels

Since the `Zowe Build and Packaging Workflow` takes a variable amount of time to complete based on the build artifacts selected, e.g. PAX ~ 7m, SMP/e ~ 25m, PSWI ~ 45m, and the build locks a system for its duration, we are conservative in our automated build frequency and build output. These workflows only run when manually requested and on pushes to PRs against default branches, and the build automation is setup to only build PAX files by default. This restriction and conservative approach is also true for tests; we only run an install test against a single system when a pull request build completes successfully. However, since this repository covers a broad set of tools and purpose, and some changes may require builds of SMP/e or PSWI artifacts or no artifacts at all, the behavior or builds triggered within a PR can be modified by adding labels. The following labels are supported and modify the behaviors of automated builds in pull requests:

Build Labels:
* Build: None
* __Build: PAX__ (default)
* Build: SMPE
* Build: PSWI
* Build: Kubernetes
* Build: Debug-Remote

`Build: None` will supersede other build labels; the rest of the build labels act by composition. `Build: PSWI` auto-includes SMP/e, as SMP/e is required to build the PSWI. Using both `Build: SMPE` and `Build: PSWI` will create just the one PSWI. `Build: Debug-Remote` is a special label that can retain some server-side build information for additional debugging. Please check with the Systems squad before adding this label.

Test Labels:
* Test: None
* __Test: Basic__ (default)
* Test: SMPE
* Test: Extended
* Test: Silly (Release Tests; about 5 hours to complete)

Tests do _not_ work by composition, and instead will default to the smallest test suite by specified label. Test composition requires far more refactoring, so the work on that is deferred pending requirement from other squads. The decision to default to the least amount of testing is to avoid locking up our systems unnecessarily. 

#### Creating a Custom Zowe Build

If your changes are in `zowe-install-packaging`, you can create a custom zowe build by either manually triggering a `Zowe Build and Packaging` github workflow using your branch, or by opening a pull request which will automatically start a Zowe build.

If your changes are in components represented by the [Zowe Manifest](#manifest-metadata), your options depend on how the Zowe build picks up your changes:

- If you released a snapshot build of your component, very likely the change will be picked up by the `vx.y/staging` branch build. If not, review the `binaryDependencies` section in `manifest.json.template` [file specification](#binary-dependencies).
- If your changes are still in a branch of a component repository, you should create a new branch in `zowe-install-packaging` where you edit the `manifest.json.template` file directly to use your component's branch build. 

```
  "org.zowe.explorer.jobs": {
    "artifact": "lib-snapshot-local/org/zowe/explorer/jobs/0.2.7-MY-BRANCH-BUILD.zip",
    "explode": "true"
  },
```

#### Component Tracking

Pull Requests are always required to make changes to the `zowe-install-packaging` repository. Generally, pull requests against any `rc` or `master` branch must be approved and merged by a member of the Zowe Systems Squad, while pull requests against `staging` may be approved by other Zowe squads.

### Containers

Zowe produces a containerized distribution which lets you run Zowe's server side components, minus the ZSS, in a Kubernetes environment. The container definitions for Zowe's base containers and automation are part of this repository, under the [containers](../containers/) directory. See the [conformance document](../containers/conformance.md) for more information on best practices for consuming the images and style guidelines for writing Zowe Dockerfiles. 

Container builds include the following workflows:

* [Base Image Build](../.github/workflows/base-images.yml)
* [Base JDK Image Build](../.github/workflows/base-jdk-images.yml)
* [Base Node Image Build](../.github/workflows/base-node-images.yml)
* [Launch Script Images Build](../.github/workflows/zowe-launch-scripts-images.yml)
* (deprecated - docker compose) [Server Bundle Images Build](../.github/workflows/server-bundle-base-images.yml)

All of these builds rely heavily on helper actions defined in [zowe-actions](https://github.com/zowe-actions/shared-actions/), though the build process is standard - build each image and publish to Artifactory. The containers are built for both x86 and s390x architectures, after which the manifests are merged together and published to Artifactory.

### Release Process

Zowe follows a regular release cadence for all of it's supported release lines, as outlined in the [community documentation](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Project%20Management/Schedule/Zowe%20PI%20%26%20Sprint%20Cadence.md). As outlined in the branch strategy, Zowe releases are first created in the `vN.x/rc` branch, and after the community has verified the RC candidates the final release is created from the `Vn.x/master` branch. The Systems Squad is responsible for release engineering activities and can be contacted for further details on the exact release process.

### Packaging, Install, Configuration




## Distribution Formats

Zowe is a collection of both distributed client and mainframe server-side components, with consumers have that have various restrictions on their ability to consume both groups of software, and processes that require us to create artifacts according to mainframe standards and practices. All that to say, we've created multiple distributions of client and server components which in net try to address the most common consumer requirements for software acquisition and all represent the same Zowe components. 

This document will capture where the components are deployed today to illustrate our thinking around them, though the final say will be either in Zowe docs (docs.zowe.org), the [Zowe community repo](https://github.com/zowe/community), or of course the components respective source repositories.

### Client Components

The Zowe client components at time of writing refer to the Zowe CLI, Zowe Explorer for VSCode, Zowe Explorer for IntelliJ, and various Zowe Client SDKs, including a Node SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Kotlin SDK. In general, client components are deployed to registries which are standard for the language and package environments, and more popular or mature components ([GA/LTS designation](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/projects.md)) may additionally be available via a zowe.org download when it makes sense. Each component follows the below table for distribution. In general, this repository does not manage the deployment of the client projects to these destinations, so as part of the release process we ask the client component squads to update the manifest json

| Component | Distribution Formats | Notes | 
| ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| Zowe CLI | NPM Package, Standalone Bundle (offline-installable) | The Zowe CLI is an NPM project and is easily installed by NPM through npmjs.com, however many of our consumers don't have access to the npmjs.com package registry. Therefore, a standalone bundle which includes all of the CLI's dependencies is provided for download on [zowe.org](https://zowe.org), and can be installed with a standard `npm install` command. | 
| Zowe Explorer for VSCode | VSCode Extension Marketplace, OpenVSX | The Zowe Explorer for VSCode is available through two common VSCode marketplaces - the official VSCode Marketplace and open-vsx.org. There is a VSIX which can be installed offline, though this is only available through its [github releases](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-explorer-vscode/releases), and is generally not required for most consumers. |
| Zowe Explorer for IntelliJ | [IntelliJ Plugin Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18688-zowe-explorer) |  The Zowe Explorer for IntelliJ is available through Intellij's Plugin Marketplace. There is no other installation available. | 
| Zowe Node SDK | NPM Package, zowe.org | The Zowe Node SDK is the backbone of the Zowe CLI, and it's available on npmjs.com. Since the Node SDK is the backbone of the Zowe CLI and also an LTS (long term support) component, we made it available on zowe.org as an offline installable package. |
| Zowe Python SDK | Pypy | The Zowe Python SDK is an incubating project which is available through PyPI and installable with pip. |
| Zowe Java SDK | Maven Central | The Zowe Java SDK is a GA poject which is available through maven central |
| Zowe Kotlin SDK | Zowe Artifactory | The Zowe Kotlin SDK is an LTS project which is available through Zowe's artifactory |

## PSWI

## z/OSMF Portable Software Instance For Zowe z/OS Components - Technology Preview

The Zowe z/OSMF Portable Instance - Technology Preview (Zowe PSWI) is the new way of Zowe z/OS components distribution.

## Version

The Zowe PSWI was build on top of SMP/E data sets of Zowe version 1.24. 

## Prerequisities

To be able to use the Zowe PSWI, you need to fulfill a few prerequisites: 
- The current version of the Zowe PSWI was built for the z/OSMF 2.3 and higher. The z/OSMF 2.2 and lower is not supported.
- The user ID you are using for the Zowe PSWI deployment must have READ access to the System Authorization Facility (SAF) resource that protects the Zowe data sets that are produced during the creation of the Zowe PSWI. That is, your user ID requires READ access to data set names with **ZWE** HLQ. Please note, that the prefix is subject to change as the current Zowe PSWI is a technology preview.
- The Zowe PSWI package has about 1.2 GB, please make sure you have enough space available on your system.

## Installation

As the Zowe PSWI is a technology preview, the official Zowe documentation is still in progress. You can reffer to IBM's [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=zosmf-portable-software-instances-page) covering Portable Software Instances related tasks. Later, there should be available a blog covering the Zowe PSWI installation process.

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

- It is not a real issue, but it is worth to mention it. You need to make sure, that in the sysplex environment you have defined a SYSAFF variable in the job header with proper value. Otherwise, deployment jobs might be submitted on the wrong system.
- If you have never used workflows in the z/OSMF, you should configure your job statement for workflows engine. For more details please refer to the IBM's [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=task-customizing-job-statement-workflows-your-system).

## Additional Resources

If you would like to read more about Zowe Portable Software Instance, please wait for a while for a blog post that will be released soon. A link will be updated here.
