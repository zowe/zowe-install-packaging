| apar-bucket.txt |
+-----------------+

List of APAR numbers (IOxxxxx) that can be be used for non-PTF APAR
builds. When an APAR must be created, cut the first line and paste it
to the top of ptf-bucket.txt before requesting a build.
- APAR numbers MUST be provided by a Zowe build engineer
  working for IBM, as the Zowe community currently relies on
  IBM-internal tooling to guarantee unique naming
- Lines starting with # are interpreted as comments
- A data line must have this format
  <apar>
  1) <apar> Blank-delimited list of 1 or more linked APAR numbers
            (IOxxxxx) to be used for a build.

Note: Security/integrity issues require special treatment, and are 
      processed using a special APAR that has the sec/int flag set.
      It is expected that each PTF will resolve one or more sec/int
      issues. To simplify administration work, sec/int APARs are not
      pulled from apar-bucket.txt and tracked in current-apar.txt, but
      are added to a ptf definition in ptf-bucket.txt. Upon PTF
      promotion, an IBM-employed build engineer will handle the special
      treatment for the embedded sec/int APAR during the APAR closing 
      process.

NOTE FOR PULL REQUEST APPROVER: 
This file may only be updated when IBM provides more PTF numbers, or
when a Release Candidate PTF is promoted. Reject ALL other updates.


The absence or presence of ptf-bucket.txt is used by the SMP/E build
process to determine whether the FMID or a PTF must be shipped.
If not present, we are in FMID mode, otherwise in PTF mode.

When ptf-bucket.txt is present, it is interpreted to determine whether
a PTF, APAR, or USERMOD must be created.
- PTF and APAR numbers MUST be provided by a Zowe build engineer
  working for IBM, as the Zowe community currently relies on
  IBM-internal tooling to guarantee unique naming
- Lines starting with # are interpreted as comments
- A data line must be one of these formats:
  <ptf> [...] - <apar> [...]
  <ptf> [...] - <apar> [...] [<sec/int apar>]
  or   [only when copied in from apar-bucket.txt]
  <apar>
  1) <ptf>  Blank-delimited list of 1 or more linked PTF numbers
            (UOxxxxx) to be used for a build
  2) -      Separator token between <ptf> and <apar>
  3) <apar> Blank-delimited list of 1 or more linked APAR numbers
            (IOxxxxx) to be used for a build. If <ptf> is present,
            then <apar> must be the APARs that are the base for <ptf>.
- There can be multiple data lines, only the first one will be used
- If no data lines are present, a USERMOD will be created
- If the first data line does not have "<ptf>", then an APAR will
  be created
- If the first data line has "<ptf>", then a PTF will be created that
  will SUP the APAR(s) listed in "<apar>"

Note: Security/integrity issues require special treatment, and are 
      processed using a special APAR that has the sec/int flag set.
      It is expected that each PTF will resolve one or more sec/int
      issues. To simplify administration work, sec/int APARs are not
      pulled from apar-bucket.txt and tracked in current-apar.txt, but
      are added to a ptf definition in ptf-bucket.txt. Upon PTF
      promotion, an IBM-employed build engineer will handle the special
      treatment for the embedded sec/int APAR during the APAR closing 
      process.
      
The file will be updated during promote (promoted PTF is commented out).

+-------------------+
| current-close.txt |
+-------------------+

Generic text block that is used to create the closing information
comments inside a PTF. There are multiple syntax/content rules in play
for this so that the PTF can be processed by IBM's Shopz back-end.
DO NOT ALTER unless you consulted with a Zowe build engineer working
for IBM.
IBM reference: PDR602 - Standardization of SMP PTF
- Round brackets, ( & ), must be present in pairs

| current-hold-*.txt |
+--------------------+

Hold information specific for this PTF/APAR/USERMOD. Can be created
manually when needed for shipping an APAR to a customer. The wildcard
in the file name must be a valid hold type in upper case (e.g. ACTION).
- ACTION: Action(s) required before/after applying PTF
- AO: Automated operations updates required before / after applying PTF
- DOC: Messages or codes added/changed by the PTF
- More types are possible, see the list of "System Reason IDs" in the
  z/OS Knowledge Center, "z/OS SMP/E Reference"
  > "SMP/E modification control statements" > "++HOLD MCS"

For official PTF builds, this file is created by the build pipline, which
pulls the info from all the pull-requests contributing to this build.

This file will be erased & merged into promoted-hold.txt during promote.
Syntax rules:
- Max 64 col
- Round brackets, ( and ), must be present in pairs
- Comment markers, /* and */, must NOT be present (this includes
  //* for comment lines in sample JCL)
- The tilde, ~, must NOT be present as it used by the sed command to 
  parse the file. Adjust smpe/bld/smpe-service.sh if usage is required.
- Hold text must start with a flower box

| current-apar.txt |
+------------------+

After an APAR build (see ptf-bucket.txt), the developer must move the
APAR numbers from ptf-bucket.txt to this file so that future
PTF/APAR/USERMOD builds can supersede the APAR(s).
This file will be erased & merged into promoted-apar.txt during promote.

| fixed-hold-*.txt |
+------------------+

Hold information that is added to every PTF/APAR/USERMOD build. The
wildcard in the file name must be a valid hold type in upper case
(e.g. ACTION). See current-hold-*.txt for syntax information.
