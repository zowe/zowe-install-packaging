# Zowe Open Source Project - This file can be used as properties file to define security permits for Zowe

# Before using this workflow, you will have to make the following
# modifications:
#
# 1) Update the PRODUCT statement to match your security
#    product.
#
# 2) Update the ADMINGRP statement to match the desired
#    group name for Zowe administrators.
#
# 3) Update the STCGRP statement to match the desired
#    group name for started tasks.
#
# 4) Update the ZOWEUSER statement to match the desired
#    user ID for the ZOWE started task.
#
# 5) Update the ZISUSER statement to match the desired
#    user ID for the ZIS started task.
#
# 6) Update the ZOWESTC statement to match the desired
#    Zowe started task name.
#
# 7) Update the ZISSTC statement to match the desired
#    ZIS started task name.
#
# 8) Update the AUXSTC statement to match the desired
#    ZIS Auxiliary started task name.
#
# 9) Update the HLQ statement to match the desired
#     Zowe data set high level qualifier.
#
# 10) Update the SYSPROG statement to match the existing
#     user ID or group used by z/OS system programmers.
#
# 11) When not using AUTOUID and AUTOGID to assign z/OS UNIX UID
#     and GID values, update the SET *ID= statements to match the
#     desired UID and GID values.
#
# 12) When using Top Secret, update the Top Secret specific SET
#     statements.
#
# Note(s):
#
# 1. THE USER ID THAT RUNS THIS JOB MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
#    TO ALTER SECURITY DEFINITONS
#
# 2. The sample ACF2 commands create ROLEs that match the group
#    names. Due to permits assigned to the &STCGRP ROLE, it is
#    advised to ensure this ROLE has a unique identifier.
#
# 3. The Zowe started task user ID (variable ZOWEUSER) must be able
#    to write persistent data in the zlux-app-server/deploy directory
#    structure. This sample JCL makes the Zowe started task part of
#    the Zowe administrator group (SET STCGRP=&ADMINGRP. statement)
#    to achieve this goal. Another solution, also below, which you can
#    comment out, is giving the Zowe started task CONTROL access to
#    the UNIXPRIV SUPERUSER.FILESYS profile.

# The sample RACF and ACF2 commands assume AUTOUID and AUTOGID are
# enabled. When this is not the case, or you are using Top Secret,
# provide appropriate (numeric) values to these SET commands.

#           ZISUID               * UID for ZIS started task User
#
# For RACF: If using AUTOUID and AUTOGID, the RACF database must be
#           at AIM 2 or higher, and BPX.NEXT.USER must exist.
# For ACF2: If using AUTOUID and AUTOGID, an AUTOIDOM GSO Record must
#           exist.
# For Top Secret: If a default UID and GID range is defined, you can
#                 specify '?' in the  *ID= statements to utilize
#                 auto-assignment of UID and GID.
